# Moon Data Classification

In this notebook, the task was to build and deploy a custom model in SageMaker.
Specifically, define and train a custom, PyTorch neural network to create a binary
classifier for data that is separated into two classes; the data looks like two 
moon shapes when it is displayed, and if often referred to as moon data. 
This project is from Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree program.
